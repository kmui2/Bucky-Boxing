Project Instructions: 	This project simulates real-world boxing. A player can block or attack using their board. 
			To attack, press the directional button to attack in that respective direction.
			The player recieving the attack has 4 intervals (timing specified in code) to block the attack
			by moving the joystick on that direction or else the victim 
			receives damage. Players can detect where the attack is comming from by the popup on the 
			edges of the screen. Players have 8 health points and each damage deals 1 health point.
			Players lose or win when one player reaches 0 health and the game ends. 
			

My role in the project: I did much of the organization of the code like placing comments, splitting up code into
			segments in the main method, and creating the helper function
			that draws either a black or red rectangle in a given direction to indicate attacks.

Workload Breakdown:    	Micah (25%) was very experience in programming and translated much of the code from the flowchart
			Brendan made. Brendan structured the flowchart and modified it while the rest of us
			were also changing up our code 25%. Jared helped by testing our boards after each load
			and told us when he finds a problem while we were working on the code itself 25%. I mostly found
			functions in the api and gave advice in code organization 25%. 		

What I learned from the project:	I gained experience in using an API efficiently. I learned how to use header files
					to search for useful functions. Also, I learned the concept of how each electrical 
					component like the touchscreen and the LEDs are accessed using a computer program.
					I can apply these software to hardware concepts to mobile development as well. 

Suggestions:   	I would suggest that the readings for each lab were shorter and the class introduce computer programming
		fundamentals resources to the students before programming in C.
